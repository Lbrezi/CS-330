1. How do I approach designing software?
  - What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    - A general better understanding of UI/UX design and coding principles.
  - What design process did you follow for your project work?
    - I following an iterative approach in my project
  - How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    - Moving into future projects taking how I designed the project from the top-down would be a strong idea. It helped me map out the environment first which helps me place things more intentionally to avoid issues down the line if I wanted to make smaller changes.

2. How do I approach developing programs?
  - What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    - Some strategies I incorporated are the following: Object Oriented Design, Procedural Generation for textures, and materials. Efficient shader and lighting management. As well as some player controlled cameras to navigate and view the scene.
  - How did iteration factor into your development?
    - It was a huge part of my project because since I was able to visually see the change in my code when I altered it, I was more specifically able to tailor things to be the way that I wanted them to be. Everything in my project was iteratively tweaked many times  throughout the development cycle.
  - How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    - At the beginning of the project through the early milestones my primary goal was just for the code to function when I ran it. Then as I got more comfortable I improved the functionality of it to act precisely the way I wanted it to. Towards the end of the final project when my comfortability was at its highest I shifted away from worrying about the functionality and to altering the aesthetics and optimizing parts of it to be more visually appealing. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
  - How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    - Computational graphics and visualizations greatly improve my skill as a coder because it lets me see visually how my code is impacting something directly, with the eye can see. The output of your code is more abstract and for me was a really good way to improve my skill. This can be applied in many varying different ways, but the main thing is that working on more projects that lead to some visual output will help me greatly in more understanding of my code.
    - In a professional setting this same concept can be leveraged. It will help me create well thought out code that is easily understood and maintainable. It more importantly will help me create code that functions exactly as I intend it too in more dynamic ways.
